                <p>We need you to help us find a good <b>analogy</b> for a target product description. Two products are analogous if they both <b>solve a closely related problem</b> and/or the same/different problem using <b>similar key mechanisms.</b></p>
                <p>As an example, consider the following two product descriptions.</p>

                        Glide is designed to keep a chef's fingers safe from slicing, along with the stench of garlic or onion. The device clips discreetly onto your knife, moving effortlessly up and down the blade to clean it without the need for napkins or fingers.

                        Broom Groomer is a step-on dustpan with added functionality that makes sweeping easier. Rubber "teeth" on the back of the dustpan let you quickly and easily comb out dust bunnies from your broom's bristles.

                <p>These two products are analogous because they both <b>SEPARATE</b> objects <span>(chopped food, dust bunnies)</span> from a host object <span>(knife, broom bristles)</span> by <b>CAUSING</b> the host object to <b>PASS THROUGH</b> another object <span>(clip, rubber teeth)</span></p>

                <p>We are specifically <b>not</b> looking for matches to a product based on <u>superficial similarity</u>, but do not solve similar problems or use similar key mechanisms. For example, consider the following pair of products, which are similar in that they are both "food/cooking/kitchen" products, but solve very different problems with different mechanisms.</p>
